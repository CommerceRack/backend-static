2012.25 changes
* controller.renderFunctions
 -> changed the way pre/post text work.  They are no longer added to the value before it is passed into the format function. Instead, they're handled afterwards. This means that bindData.cleanValue is no longer necessary (value is always 'clean' now) and has been removed. pre/post text should be used for text only (does not support html).
 -> support for before, after and wrap have been added globally. These should be used for adding any html.

* store_prodlist
 -> removed the 'getProductDataForLaterUse' function. Use getProductDataForList instead (they were very similar functions). 
 
* store_product
 -> removed util.getXsellForPID (not necessary w/ buildQueriesFromTemplate code)
 
* quickstart
 -> change to addClass renderFormat (required because of changes to pre/posttext)
 -> some changes to reviews, including new templates and bindData's (productTemplate). new reviews img with all 11 ratings.
 -> broke changeNavTo out into separate functions, each called by showContent as needed:
	showSearch (needs testing)
	showCompany
	showCustomer
	This change was necessary because of a bug where landing on a company page resulted in an error because the profile data hadn't been loaded yet.  This is cleaner too.
 -> as part of removing changeNavTo, added a function for util.thisArticleRequiresLogin(P) (article is what a 'show' value is internally referenced as (ex: return or myaccount is an article). will return true or false based on whether P.show is a secure article (ex: show=orders requires login).



2012.20 changes
* upgrade to jquery 1.7.2
* upgrade to jqueryUI 1.8.20
* model
	- JSONP requests are now all individual (non-pipelined) to solve issue of URL being to long. (this only effect IE<8 if cross-domain)
* Checkout
	- the 'passive' and 'nice' checkouts were modified and moved into folders within extensions. a new extension 'store_checkout' was added which contains all of the shared calls, callbacks, utilities and renderFormats that are likely to be used with any checkout app.
	- The templates for the 'nice' and 'passive' extensions were moved to separate .html files, stored with the extension in it's directory. This will make it much easier to change what checkout is loading in init without having to update the index.html/quickstart.html files. Those files will also be much smaller now.
* store_prodlist
	- fixed multipage header so pagination could be turned off (and will automatically be removed when only 1 page is present).
	- added support for before, after and wrap to prodlist. (experiement - if it goes well, support for this will be added to all render formats)
* store_navcats
	- added new renderFormat for dual-level nav (subcategory2LevelList)
* quickstart.js and quickstart.html
	- added support for pageFunctions,  a page/template-specific function to get executed after that page/template is loaded. ex:
	= pageFunctions.productTemplate(); would get executed after a product is loaded. (see in quickStart.html). Could be used to init tabs, carousels, slideshows, etc.
	= pageFunctions.customerTemplate(); 
* productTemplate upgraded to use loadsTemplate on prodlists and review elements. what was several templates is now four (productTemplate, productListTemplate [for accessories and related items], productListTemplateChildren and productReviewsTemplateDetail (for review list).
* categoryTemplate now has a breadcrumb added to sample.
* cartTemplate updated. uses loadsTemplate and what was three templates is now two (cartTemplate and productListTemplateCart)
* removed renderFormat subcategory2LevelList (moved to store_navcats)
* banner element will now only render if IMG is set in val (ALT=&IMG=&LINK=).
* Changed the class 'itemCount' to 'cartItemCount' and added 'cartSubtotal' and 'cartTotal'. if there is a minicart in the theme and you need these values, set the class on an elemend. ex: <div>you have <span class='cartItemCount'></span> item(s) in your cart</div>
