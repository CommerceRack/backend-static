TO DO


look for ??? and !!! in all files and solve any outstanding questions/concerns/fixes.
!!! - something that needs to be fixed.
??? - something that needs to be looked in to or a question answered for optimization. not show stopping
### - future enhancement.



1.  Move sharedCheckout stuff into checkout
2.  there's a ping that gets fired as part of XSELL even if data is already in memory or local storage. see about fixing that.
4. make sure 'get root cats' in navcats takes into account profile root cat id.

5. Test new abortQ function. probably should add this in to a few commands, like show prod and loadpage

6. get 'recent searches' saving to localStorage
7. choose listing style for page and results. should be easy. just templateID to point at vars.user.plStyle


42.  compatibility test everything that's been built so far across browsers.


// make sure all calls return something
// make sure all/most calls support specifying a q.




### look into myownersbox and see why app stopped working. maybe had to do w/ model upgrade.





for working on with Brian:


1. add to cart/update cart:
	A. if I wanted to add a 'reorder' button, is there a good way to do this? passing you a fully qualified stid?
	B.  setting quantities on add to cart for multiple product request (myownersbox)

2.  add something to cart (new session). item adds, but totals don't update.

3. how does a user log out? customerLogout

4. explain 'shipping status' in order history please. in english.

5. orders DETAIL doesn't do anything

requests:
1.  faq request
2.  contact us request.
3.  create account request.
4.  recover password

long term:

1.  need to turn variations.js into an extension. (long term project).
 ->  input id's need to be SOG_PID so that multiple add to cart forms can be added at once.
 ->  the sogs themselves should NOT get copied into pogs object so that multiple options can be opened at once.


2. modify extensions loader to see if namespace() is already a function. if so, don't load extension via ajax. That'll allow for extensions to be set in script tags and reduce the number of ajax requests on init.
 -> no rush and maybe not. loading via ajax will reduce likelyhood of caching.

3. session drops all data after createOrder (new session is created).

4.  if user is logged in via facebook, they're technically 'authenticated'. where do i load/save lists from/to (wishlist).
 -> twitter, facebook, oauth, gmail, openid, etc.
